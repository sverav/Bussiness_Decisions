🎯General Objective
To prioritize marketing hypotheses for revenue growth using ICE and RICE frameworks and analyze A/B test results to determine the most effective strategies for an online store.

🧩Methodology Used

 - Hypothesis Prioritization (compared ranking differences between ICE and RICE to assess the role of Reach)
 - A/B Test Analysis: evaluated statistical significance of conversion rates and order size differences (raw and filtered data).

☘️Expected Results
 - Hypothesis Prioritization: explanation of how incorporating Reach (RICE) changes priorities compared to ICE.
 - A/B Test Analysis: identification of statistically significant differences between Groups A and B.
 - Decision on test outcome


📑Obtained Results

 - Recommendation to consider Group B as the leader and stop the test at this point if the goal is to prioritize revenue.
 - Recommendation to continue tracking the impact of the implementation of Group B's improvements to verify whether the enhancement in conversion values is sustained or continues to increase over time.
