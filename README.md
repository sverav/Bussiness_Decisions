**Objective: Prioritize marketing hypotheses and analyze A/B test results to boost revenue for an e-commerce store.**

- Hypothesis Prioritization: Applied ICE and RICE frameworks to rank 9 hypotheses, revealing shifts in priority when accounting for reach and effort.

- Key Insights:

     - Top ICE hypothesis: High confidence/impact.

     - Top RICE hypothesis: Broad reach with manageable effort.

- A/B Test Analysis: Evaluated groups A/B using cumulative revenue, average order size, and conversion rate metrics.

- Visualizations: Plotted cumulative revenue and conversion trends, showing Group B’s potential outperformance.

- Outlier Detection: Identified anomalies using 95th/99th percentiles for orders per user and order prices.

- Statistical Testing:

    - Raw data: Significant difference in conversion rates (p < 0.05).

    - Filtered data: Confirmed Group B’s higher average order size.

- Findings: Group B achieved 15% higher conversion and 10% larger average order size post-filtering.

- Decision: Recommended stopping the test and adopting Group B’s variant as the leader.

- Impact: Data-driven strategy to increase revenue with validated hypotheses and clear A/B results.

- Tools: Python (Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib), ICE/RICE frameworks, statistical testing.
